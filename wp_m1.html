            <h2>World Wide Web (WWW) and Its Evolution</h2><hr/>
            <pre>The World Wide Web (WWW) is a system of interlinked hypertext documents accessed through the Internet using web browsers. 
It was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 and became publicly accessible in 1991. 
The WWW operates using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and is built on technologies like HTML, URLs, and web browsers.

Evolution of the Web:

1. Web 1.0 (Static Web) (1991 – 2004)
   - Consisted of static web pages.
   - Users could only read the information; there was no interaction.
   - No multimedia elements (images, videos, dynamic content).

2. Web 2.0 (Dynamic and Social Web) (2004 – Present)
   - Interactive websites with user-generated content (e.g., blogs, wikis, social media).
   - Technologies like JavaScript, AJAX, and CSS enabled better user experience.
   - Platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter emerged.

3. Web 3.0 (Semantic Web & AI-based Web) (Future)
   - Focuses on machine learning, AI, and decentralized data.
   - Uses blockchain and smart contracts (e.g., cryptocurrency and NFTs).
   - More personalization and automation (e.g., AI-driven assistants).

            <pre>Telnet (TELecommunication NETwork) is a protocol used to remotely access computers over a network. 
It allows users to execute commands on a remote system as if they were physically present.

Features of Telnet:
- Uses port 23 by default.
- Provides a command-line interface to access remote computers.
- Security Concern: Data transmission is not encrypted, so it has been largely replaced by SSH (Secure Shell).

            <h2>FTP (File Transfer Protocol)</h2><hr/>
            <pre>FTP is a standard network protocol used to transfer files between computers.

Types of FTP Connections:
1. Active FTP: The server actively connects to the client’s data port.
2. Passive FTP: The client requests the server to open a data port for file transfer.

Common FTP Commands:
- get filename → Downloads a file.
- put filename → Uploads a file.
- ls → Lists files in the directory.

Secure Alternatives to FTP:
- SFTP (Secure FTP): Uses SSH to encrypt data.
- FTPS (FTP Secure): Uses SSL/TLS encryption.
